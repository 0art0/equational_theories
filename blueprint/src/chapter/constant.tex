\chapter{Equivalence with the constant and singleton laws}

\href{https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/Generated/Constant.lean}{85 laws} have been shown to be equivalent to the constant law (Definition \ref{eq46}), and \href{https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/Generated/Singleton.lean}{815 laws} have been shown to be equivalent to the singleton law (Definition \ref{eq2}).

{\bf describe the process of automatically generating these implications here.}
